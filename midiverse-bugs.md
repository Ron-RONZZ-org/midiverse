- `/markmaps`
  - author name should be link to user profile
  - if the markmap is in a series, series name should be shown as link to a page listing all markmaps in the series
- `/search`
  - keyword search
    - bug : all markmaps shown including those not containing at all the searched keyword
  - add series filter
    - available when author filter used
- `/user/{self-username}`
  - add for own markmaps
    - visibility filter checkboxes: published/private/action required
    - sorting : alphabetical/creation date
      - inverse
    - search : similar to keyword search in `/search` but limited to own markmaps
- `/editor`
  - save user input in localstorage
    - restore on reload (in case of accidental refresh/closing)
  - manual keynode detection
    - In all markmaps, manual references to keynodes should be recognised and processed accordingly. As long as a link like `/search?keynode=FreeCAD%20Mesh%20workbench` is present, the keynode is present. It can be in markdown format `[]()`, or HTML format `<a>` what-so-ever.
